Communication needs to be concise and effective.

## Feedback
**Neutral feedback** message was received. EX: uhuh. mmmm. *nod*
**Evaluative feedback** positive response. EX: okay. great. smile.
**Constructive feedback** tries to get a positive outcome by giving comments, suggestions, advice.
**Student peer feedback** done by peers.

## Making Positive Impression
**Avoid Negative Statements**
the data is not reliable -> the data is unreliable
the numbers are not accurate -> the numbers are inaccurate
the code is not optimized -> the code is unoptimized

**Make listeners agree by asking question tags**
